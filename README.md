# Quantifying the Impact of COVID19 on Nifty50 Using PCA

Frameworks used and skills learnt: Python, PCA, Machine Learning, Statsmodel, SciPy, Quandl, CAPM

Brief Overview of the project\
• The framework of the project was Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), used for pricing the returns of an asset, with
many interesting connections to the modern portfolio theory.

• Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was implemented which is a powerful data analytic tool used in many areas of
machine learning.

• Using PCA, one can cluster together businesses that were most/least affected stocks of Nifty50 by the COVID19
pandemic, without any prior knowledge of their fundamentals. item
